##Method to implement parameter in component.yaml file. Key must contain everything after Parameter from SSP

Eg:
  parameters:
    - key:                 AC-1(a)
      text:                all staff with access to Production  systems
    - key:                 AC-1(b)1
      text:                at least every 3 years
    - key:                 AC-1(b)2
      text:                at least annually

##Multiple ways to implement implementation status:
 Eg:
 implementation_status: partial
      
            or
 
 implementation_statuses:
   - partial
 
            or         
 
 implementation_statuses:
   - partial
   - none

##Multiple ways to implement control origin or origins:
Eg:
  control_origin: shared
  
          or

  control_origins:
    - shared
          
          or
  
  control_origins: 
    - service_provider_corporate 
    - hybrid
  

  The controls mapping the yaml file and the SSP is in common/origin/origin.go and common/status/status.go
